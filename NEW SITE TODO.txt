Site Buildout
------------------
--- Flask Site Buildout
---- Lay out routes
----- /about - about
------ page
------ method
----- /archives - archives page
------ page
------ method

------ Display 3 posts with prev and next links
---- On startup / deploy, load site_data.json into memory. This will contain KVPs of categories, tags, dates : articles and such

--- Pagination
---- Three posts per query / page. Just use '<< previous' and 'next >>' as necessary.
---- Order posts by date, most recent at top

Future Enhancements:
----- /blog/tags/tag_name
----- /blog/categories/category_name
------ Display 3 posts with prev and next links


Jinja Templates
------------------
-- Create a base_template.html - contains header and footer
-- Create article template
-- Create about template
-- Create archives template
-- Need to figure out tagging, categories and such


----
--- Archives
---- Need to see how others do the large, medium, small text tags. I'm thinking 3-5 css classes placed on spans in the <p>.
----- If I do this in flask, in theory, when I build / deploy the site, I could create a site_data.json file that has categories and tags (with counts) aggregated across articles.
--- Older Posts (Display when more than 3 posts remaining in post timeline history. On click, load up the next 3 pages). Users use back button to go back.
--- Favicon - get this working.
--- RSS Feed  - need to generate like I do now on chriszacny.com


--- need to lay out jinja templates
---- OR consider just doing this as a Flask webserver again.


Deployment Managment
------------------
-- Create a build script of sorts that takes current Git content, generates appropriate files, and deploys to my dreamhost server. Need to restart the passenger.py processs to pic up new site_data.json. (Fabric?)


- Build pelican theme using foundation layouts.
-- Lay out (all assets) in HTML using HTML 5 best practices / tags
---- which tag to use: http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png

Misc Notes
------------------

--- Foundation - layout / typography
--- Penscratch - look and feel ???
--- Pelican (Smashing) - ???
