NEW SITE TODO
================

-- Dreamhost Server: ???

Site Buildout
------------------
--- Archives
---- Need to see how others do the large, medium, small text tags. I'm thinking 3-5 css classes placed on spans in the <p>.
----- If I do tihs in flask, in theory, when I build / deploy the site, I could create a archives.dat file that has categories and tags (with counts) aggregated across articles.
--- Favicon - get this working.
--- RSS Feed  - need to generate like I do now on chriszacny.com
--- display three pages, then Archives button
--- need to lay out jinja templates for theme
---- OR consider just doing this as a Flask webserver again.

Apache / Dreamhost Configuration
------------------
-- Set up subdomain: fitness.chriszacny.com. Redirect this to chriszacny.com.


Deployment Managment
------------------
-- Create a build script of sorts that takes current Git content, generates appropriate files, and deploys to my dreamhost server. (Fabric?)


- Build pelican theme using foundation layouts. 
-- Lay out (all assets) in HTML using HTML 5 best practices / tags
---- which tag to use: http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png
